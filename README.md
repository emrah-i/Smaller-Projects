<h2>About the Projects</h2>

<h4>Pomodoro:</h4>
<p>This Pomodoro application was created exclusively using Python's TKinter module, without incorporating any web components. It was developed independently as part of my journey through the Udemy course <ins>"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp,"</ins> however, I built it entirely from the ground up. The most challenging aspect of this undertaking was undoubtedly the user interface, as TKinter's limited customization options posed a significant hurdle. Nonetheless, the remainder of the project mainly entailed establishing loops and managing code to ensure UI updates.</p>

<p>The functionality of the application is quite simple. Clicking the start button starts a timer for 25 minutes. Once it reaches zero, you hear a beep noise and the break starts. This continues for a total of 5 cycles before it allows the user to take a longer 25 minute break. These cycles can be tracked with green check marks shown under the tomato. The timer can be stopped using the 'stop' button. Once stopped, the user must click the 'start' button to begin where they left off. The 'reset' button completely resets the timer and the cycle progress.</p>

<h4>Flashcards:</h4>
<p>I developed this Flashcard application as part of my journey through the Udemy course <ins>"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp,"</ins> once again, starting from scratch. The only resources I utilized from external sources were the flashcard images and a list of the 1000 most commonly used Turkish words.</p>

<p>Upon launching the application, the screen will display a flashcard featuring a Turkish word, indicated by the 'Turkish' label. Clicking on the flashcard triggers it to flip, revealing the English definition on the reverse side, indicated by the 'English' label. At the top, the application displays statistics on the learned words with current launch, total learned words, and those remaining in the deck. Additionally, there is a red and green buttons that enables users to categorize a word as either 'learned' or 'not learned,' with this information being automatically saved to a JSON file. Upon reloading the application, words from the JSON file are removed from the deck, preserving your progress and allowing you to seamlessly resume where you left off during your next session.</p>

<h4>Pong:</h4>
<p>This is a straightforward rendition of the classic Pong game, created using Python's Turtle module and a series of classes. The primary goal behind its development was to gain hands-on experience with <ins>Object-Oriented Programming</ins> principles. In essence, there are four key classes at play: ball, paddles, score, and center line.
<ul>
  <li>The ball class handles various aspects of the ball's behavior, such as its speed and functionality, including movement, acceleration, resetting, and collision interactions with both paddles and walls.</li>
  <li>The paddle class defines the dimensions of the paddles and their movement speed.</li>
  <li>The score class takes charge of displaying and continually updating the game score whenever a player scores a point.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the center line class is responsible for drawing the central dividing line.</li>
</ul>
To get the game up and running, all that's required is configuring the ball's attributes and assigning the movement keys for the paddles.</p>

<h4>Snake:</h4>
<p>Similar to my Pong game, this is another remake of a classic game using Python's turtle module in order to practice <ins>Object Oriented Programming.</ins> There are four key classes for this game: food, scoreboard, and snake.
<ul>
  <li>The food is the red dot that gets randomly placed around the gameboard. Once it touches the snake, it automatically moves to a new location. </li>
  <li>The scoreboard keeps track of how many pieces of food the snake has consumed and updates the scoreboard with each new point.</li>
  <li>Lastly, the snake starts with a length of three segments and grows with each new piece of food. The most difficult part was making sure that each segment follows the segment before it. Also, the snake has to be moving fast enough so the gaps between the segments weren't visible.</li>
</ul>
